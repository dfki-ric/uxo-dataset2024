@article{Maser.2020,
 abstract = {The seas worldwide are threatened by a {\textquotedbl}new{\textquotedbl} source of pollution: millions of tons of all kind of warfare material have been dumped intentionally after World War I and II, in addition to mine barriers, failed detonations as well as shot down military planes and sunken ship wrecks carrying munitions. For example, in the German parts of the~North and Baltic Sea approximately 1.6 million metric tons of toxic conventional explosives (TNT and others) and more than 5000 metric tons of chemical weapons are present. Such unexploded ordnance (UXO) constitutes a direct risk of detonation with increased human access (fisheries, water sports, cable constructions, wind farms and pipelines). Moreover, after more than 70~years of resting on the seabed, the metal shells of these munitions items corrode, such that chemicals leak out and distribute in the marine environment. Explosive chemicals such as TNT and its derivatives are known for their toxicity and carcinogenicity. In order not to endanger today's shipping traffic or the installation of pipelines and offshore plants by uncontrolled explosions, controlled blast-in-place (BiP) operations of these dangerous relics is a common practice worldwide. However, blast-in-place methods of in situ munitions disposal often result in incomplete (low-order) detonation, leaving substantial quantities of the explosive material in the environment. In the present free field investigation, we placed mussels (Mytilus spp.) as a biomonitoring system in an area of the Baltic Sea where BiP operations took place and where, by visual inspections by scientific divers, smaller and larger pieces of munitions-related materials were scattered on the seafloor. After recovery, the mussels were transferred to our laboratory and analyzed for TNT and its derivatives via gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that low-order BiP operations of dumped munitions in the sea lead to multiple increases in the concentration of TNT and its metabolites in the mussels when compared to similar studies at corroding but still encased mines. For this reason, we explicitly criticize BiP operations because of the resulting environmental hazards, which can ultimately even endanger human seafood consumers.},

	abstract = {Abstract The estimation of the geometric structure of objects located underwater underpins a plethora of applications such as mapping shipwrecks for archaeology, monitoring the health of coral reefs, detecting faults in offshore oil rigs and pipelines, detection and identification of potential threats on the seabed, etc. Acoustic imaging is the most popular choice for underwater sensing. Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle.},
